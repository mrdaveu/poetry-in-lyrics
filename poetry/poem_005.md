管不得

Can’t be bothered

未熄的火～爐

with the stove still~ burning

鞋帶不綁

Rushed out

就匆匆出～門

with shoelace~ untied

情願 在路上訂票

Would rather book

去追 最夜的夜航

the last flight on my way

飛奔你病床

Sprinting to your bedside

全身的～淚

All my tears

湧出～來 沒法乾

spill out~ with no signs of drying<br><br>

*或者今日 還未 成熟到

Perhaps we are yet to reach the stage where

大方通電 前度 仍問好

we could call and ask “how are you”

若果出事 連夜聯繫我 隨時趕到

But if something happens and you need me, I’ll be there

不理 現已 墮進 誰懷抱

Regardless of whose embrace you are in

都肯 應你召喚

I am willingly summoned

你說一句就好

Simply drop me a text

###### Just Let Me Know*<br><br>

沒法牽手共老

We may not grow old together

亦記得挨住你 胸口

But I still remember leaning on your chest

起舞

Us dancing<br><br>

練習在大街中跑～步

Practised jogging down the~ avenue

練習漏夜飛車趕～路

Rehearsed speeding late~ at night

藏好 小背包一個

I have a luggage packed

等你急需我

for when you need me

一秒展開旅途

Ready to head off in a split second

遺蹟多美

The beauty of relics

這刻終揭露…

revealed in an instant

分開～後

After we parted

都依～然 為你好

still, I wish you well<br><br>

###### **&ast;—repeat—&ast;**<br><br>

就算不可共老

Even though we won’t be growing old side by side

亦記得一齊過

I will always remember when we were together

盛夏光年

That summer

那一段塵封 情愫

Those dusted feelings<br><br>

在生一日

I am tethered to you for

還是 連住你

as long as I am still living

肉身倒下

Your body may have fallen

聯繫 還未倒

but our connection has not

在冰山上 罹難 傳召我

If you are stuck on a glacier, calling for me

仍然上路

I shall take off right away

不要害怕

Don’t worry about

又要麻煩我

bothering me

給牽掛乃幸運

I feel lucky to be thought of

你說一句就好

Simply drop me a text

###### Just Let Me Know<br><br>

伴侶輾轉無數

The roulette of partners

但我總可陪你

At least I could share

最後 一舞

the Last. Dance. with you.
