I am what I am　我是我 多麼特別的我

I am what I am  I am me, the very special ‘me’

多慶幸　大地有不只一種足印

So glad<br> There’s more than just one kind of footprints on Earth

神造世人　種種色色都有他公允

God created human <br> All colours and races gets His endorsement

我很慶幸　站在我屋頂快樂做人

I’m so glad <br> To be standing on my rooftop living happily

拿著我心　告訴世界何謂勇敢

With my heart <br> I tell the world what it means to be brave<br><br>

我是什麼　在十個當中只得一個

What am I <br> Only one in every ten

葡萄園裡　響起水仙子的讚歌

Melodies by nymphs <br> Overheard in the vineyard

我是什麼　是萬世沙礫當中一顆

What am I <br> A grain of sand in sands through the ages

石頭大這麼多　我也會喜歡這個我

Rocks are so much larger <br> Yet I still like the ‘me’ I am<br><br>

我很慶幸　萬物眾生中磊落做人

I’m so glad <br> To be living amongst all beings with pride

懷著誠懇　告訴世界何謂勇敢

To sincerely tell the world <br>What it means to be brave<br><br>

感激天生這個我

I’m grateful I’m born this way
