誰把誰的靈魂 裝進誰的身體

Whose soul is a lost cause

誰把誰的身體 變成囹圄囚禁自己

Whose body turned a prison cell

亂世總是最 不缺耳語

Gossips are never lacking in troubled times

哪種美麗會 喚來妒忌 

Which beauty calls for envy

你並沒有罪 有罪是這世界

You have not wronged the world but the world you<br><br>

*生而為人無罪 

*No one is born with sins

你不需要抱歉 

You need not apologise

###### One day I will be you, baby boy and you gon' be me

喧嘩如果不停

If the noises were incessant

讓我陪你安靜

Let me be with you in silence

###### I wish I could hug you, till you’re really really being free<br><br>

哪朵玫瑰 沒有荊棘

No rose is without its thorns

最好的報復 是美麗

The best revenge is beauty

最美的盛開 是反擊

The prettiest bloom is to strike back

別讓誰去 改變了你

Don’t let anybody change you

你是你 或是妳 都行

Doesn’t matter whether you are a he or a she

會有人 全心的 愛你*

There will be people who love you wholeheartedly*
<br><br>

試著想像 you switched to his body

Imagine you switched to his body

Sexuality 當心 什麼會傷你

Sexuality Beware what can hurt

多少次的重傷

Countless assaults

多少次的冷語 

Ruthless remarks

Drowning 誰會拉你

Who would come to your rescue when you’re drowning

Dreaming 誰會陪你

Who would be by your side in your dreams

###### Same shit happens every day

你離開後 世界可改變

After your departure, has the world changed at all

多少無知罪愆

Countless sins of ignorance

事過不境遷

Time goes on regardless

永誌不忘記念

Lest we forget

往事不如煙

The fog of the past lingers still

###### **—repeat—**<br><br>

玫瑰少年 在我心裡

Rose boy you are kept in our hearts

綻放著 鮮豔的 傳奇

Blooming with your vibrant legacy

我們都 從來沒 忘記

None of us has ever forgotten

你的控訴 沒有聲音

Your petitions were muted

卻傾訴 更多的 真理

Yet they disclose truths so undeniable

卻喚醒 無數的 真心

Awakening countless others with hearts as sincere as yours
