傳來法語問你是我的家屬吧

Asked in French if you were a relative of mine

原來我已自那白朗之巔墮下

Turns out I’d fallen from Mont Blanc’s summit

明明分開

We have already separated

為何打這號碼

Why would they ring this number, you wonder
<br><br>

你可會很不解 我怎不刪了它

You may be puzzled why I didn’t delete it

我知不該 但是不改

I know I shouldn’t But not changing it

像某種流亡的愛千里之外

is like, for this exiled love, though thousand miles away,

聯繫還是依在

The connection is still there
<br><br>

*有沒有一絲半秒傷悲?

Are you, for half a sec, sad in the slightest way?

要是我今晚異地斷氣

If my breath ceases in foreign land tonight

問你可肯即夜趕搭通宵客機?

Would you rush to catch the overnight flight?
<br><br>

有沒有一絲半秒歡喜?

Are you, for half a sec, glad in the slightest way?

再無人以後來煩住你

That no one is gonna bother you anymore

若覺得將這責任加諸很離奇

If you thought such imposed responsibility was bizarre

是我自私 今世最後騷擾的人兒

It’s selfish of me that the last person I bother in this life

只想是你

Is no one but you
<br><br>

誰聯絡你 若我在某冰川遇難

Somebody would contact you If I perished in a certain glacier

然而教你負痛 亦算黑色浪漫

This would hurt you But still, it’s kinda dark romance

甜蜜那陣時

Those sweet times

鰥寡日子 總講到帶淚眼

Widowed days Tears spilling even by just talking about it
<br><br>

誰料情感無常

Who would have thought feelings were so unpredictable

這假設太簡單

This assumption was too simple

###### **—repeat—**

有沒有一絲半秒歡喜?

Were you, for half a sec, glad in the slightest way?

再無人以後去牽絆你

That no one is gonna hinder you anymore

若覺得將這責任加諸很離奇

If you thought such imposed responsibility was bizarre

是我自私 今世最後騷擾的人兒

It’s selfish of me that the last person I bother in this life

只想是你

is no one but you

必須是你

It has to be you
<br><br>

很想被念記

I really wish to be remembered

即使淡淡微微

Even if it’s in the slightest way

就算在生亦被嫌棄

Even though I was despised while I was living

都想藉遺言說好想你

I just wanna use my last words to say: I really miss you

可惜最尾未夠運氣一起

A pity that our luck ran out to be together in the end
<br><br>

有沒有一絲?

Are you in the slightest way?

要是我今晚 hm

What if tonight I.. Hm..

話到嘴邊打住

Halted mid-sentence

早變陌路人尚有幻想是大忌

We have long become strangers It’s a taboo to have these fantasies

這號碼應該長眠於手機

This number has to remain dormant in my phone

就算死亦別再騷擾你

Wouldn’t bother you anymore even if I died

若覺得這惡作劇真的很頑皮

If you thought this joke was too cheeky

在告別式給我帶淚奔喪的情人

I wish the lover who shed tears for me at my funeral

只想是你

was no one but you
